/* 
Approach 2:
-Store the nodes(values and address) in the stack until all the values are entered.
-Once all entries are done, Update the Head pointer to the last location(i.e the last value).
-Start popping the nodes(value and address) and store them in the same order until the stack is empty.
-Update the next pointer of last Node in the stack by NULL.
